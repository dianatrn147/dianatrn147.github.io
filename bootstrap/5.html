  <h1>Net Art</h1>
  <p>This is a website I coded through notepad++ and github. I built this site to remind us of other we have lost touch with. I have people in my life who I do terribly miss but the history behind us is what prevents me from talking to them. I wanted to imply a message that we should appreciate the people who have helped us or cherish the memories we had with those who are no longer in our lives.</p>
